# DSPFilterProject
Using Numpy and filtering to filter music wav files and write new wav file


This project is still in the works and needs to be revised and have functions placed into classes to better help the styling and
implementation. This was done early before studying a lot of programming; I have been wanting to come back to this and clean it up.
For now, it remains as is and is meant to run the script 'userinputone.py' which asks a series of questions on what you wav file you
want to work on and what bad frequency cutoffs you desire.
